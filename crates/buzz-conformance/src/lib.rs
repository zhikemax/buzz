//! Runtime trace schema + independent replay checker for
//! `docs/spec/MultiTenantRelay.tla`.
//!
//! North star (from the runtime-formal-compliance skill): don't ask "did the
//! model pass"; ask "did the running code emit a trace the model accepts."
//!
//! ## What this crate is
//!
//! - The **schema** ([`TraceStep`], [`TraceAction`], [`AbstractState`]) that
//!   the relay emits at its ingest/read accept-reject boundary.
//! - An **independent** replay checker ([`check_trace`]) that consumes a
//!   sequence of `TraceStep`s and validates them against the TLA+ spec's
//!   `Next` transition relation. The checker re-implements the relevant
//!   spec actions in Rust; it does NOT call any production reducer.
//!
//! ## What this crate is NOT
//!
//! - A proof. Trace conformance only checks executions you ran. Coverage is
//!   widened by integration tests, property tests, and adversarial fixtures.
//! - A re-export of production helpers. Sharing normalization helpers between
//!   the emitter (which projects implementation state) and the checker (which
//!   judges that projection) would let a bug in the helpers hide itself from
//!   both — exactly the failure the skill calls out.
//!
//! ## Failure modes (skill §Phase 4)
//!
//! - **Illegal transition** — the traced action is not allowed from the
//!   checker's current model state.
//! - **State mismatch** — `state_after.row_labels` includes a community other
//!   than the resolved tenant (`Inv_NonInterference`).
//! - **Coverage breach** — an unknown critical action, a critical seam exit
//!   without a trace step ([`TraceAction::ImplBug`]), or a scenario-required
//!   action that never appeared.
//!
//! Coverage breach is load-bearing. Without it, trace conformance is
//! decorative logging.
