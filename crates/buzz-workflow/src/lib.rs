//! `buzz-workflow` — Workflow engine for Buzz.
//!
//! Channel-scoped automations with sequential execution, variable substitution,
//! conditional logic, and execution traces.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! - [`WorkflowEngine`] — top-level handle; lives in `AppState`
//! - [`schema`] — YAML/JSON definition types (`WorkflowDef`, `TriggerDef`, `ActionDef`, `Step`)
//! - [`executor`] — sequential execution, template resolution, condition evaluation
//! - [`error`] — [`WorkflowError`] enum
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! let engine = Arc::new(WorkflowEngine::new(db, WorkflowConfig::default()));
//!
//! // Parse and validate a YAML definition.
//! let (def, json) = WorkflowEngine::parse_yaml(yaml_str)?;
//!
//! // React to an incoming event (called from event handler post-store hook).
//! // The community is the event's server-resolved tenant, threaded from the
//! // relay's bound `TenantContext` — the same workflow UUID can exist in two
//! // communities, so execution is always scoped to its owner.
//! engine.on_event(community_id, &stored_event).await?;
//!
//! // Run the background scheduler (cron triggers).
//! tokio::spawn(async move { engine.run().await });
//! ```
