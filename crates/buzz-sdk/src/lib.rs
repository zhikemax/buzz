//! `buzz-sdk` — typed Nostr event builders for Buzz operations.
//!
//! # Mental Model
//!
//! ```text
//! caller params → builder fn → validates → EventBuilder → caller signs → Event
//! ```
//!
//! Each builder function validates its inputs and returns an [`nostr::EventBuilder`].
//! The caller signs with their own keys: `builder.sign_with_keys(&keys)?`.
//! No keys are held here. No network calls are made.
