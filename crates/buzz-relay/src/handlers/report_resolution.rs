//! Report-resolution orchestrations for the HTTP admin API (Phase 2).
//!
//! Two transport-independent orchestration functions:
//!
//! - [`resolve_report_decision_only`] — HTTP `dismiss`/`escalate` and 9044
//!   community-moderation. Atomically CASes report to terminal status with
//!   a linked decision audit row in **one transaction**.
//!
//! - [`resolve_report_with_enforcement`] — HTTP `delete`/`kick`/`ban`/`timeout`.
//!   Claims the report (`open → processing`) in one transaction, acquires an
//!   action lease to prevent concurrent double-mutation, executes the durable
//!   enforcement mutation and step marker in **one atomic DB transaction**
//!   (via `execute_*_with_marker`), then finalizes (action → succeeded, report →
//!   resolved, outbox rows enqueued) in a third transaction.  Delivery is driven
//!   by the outbox worker ([`crate::handlers::admin_outbox_worker`]) and the
//!   action recovery worker ([`crate::handlers::admin_action_worker`]) — **never
//!   from this request path**.
//!
//! ## Crash safety
//!
//! Each enforcement mutation and its `step_marker = 'mutation_committed'` are
//! written in a single PG transaction (`execute_*_with_marker`). A crash between
//! claim and the mutation transaction leaves the action in `pending`/`enforcing`
//! with no step marker — the action recovery worker re-drives it via
//! `claim_stranded_action_batch`. A crash after `mutation_committed` re-drives
//! directly to `finalize_success` (marker already set → skip mutation). A crash
//! after finalization leaves outbox rows pending for the outbox worker.
//!
//! ## Action lease
//!
//! An action lease token prevents two concurrent drivers (two HTTP retries with
//! the same `request_id`) from both running the mutation branch. The loser of
//! `acquire_action_lease` gets `Contended`, reloads, and loops — seeing the
//! updated step state rather than re-running the mutation.
//!
//! ## Action matrix (frozen per Plan v3/v4 §7)
//!
//! | target_kind | actions |
//! |-------------|---------|
//! | event  | delete, kick, ban, timeout, dismiss, escalate |
//! | pubkey | ban, timeout, dismiss, escalate |
//! | blob   | dismiss, escalate |
