//! Action recovery worker for stranded `relay_admin_actions`.
//!
//! Scans for `relay_admin_actions` rows in `pending` or `enforcing` state whose
//! action lease has expired (or was never set), claims them via an exclusive lease
//! (`SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), and re-drives each through the enforcement
//! state machine via `drive_enforcement`.
//!
//! This is the crash-recovery path: if the request-handling process dies between
//! claim and finalization, this worker picks up the stranded action and resumes
//! from the persisted `step_marker` state without re-running the mutation.
//!
//! Multiple pod replicas can run this worker concurrently — the DB-level action
//! lease (`action_lease_token` / `action_lease_expires_at`) prevents double-mutation.
