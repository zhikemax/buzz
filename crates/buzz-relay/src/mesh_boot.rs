//! Relay startup wiring for the inter-relay mesh (`BUZZ_MESH` seam).
//!
//! [`boot_mesh`] is the ONLY place the relay constructs mesh machinery. It
//! returns `None` — and touches nothing — when `BUZZ_MESH=off`, so mesh-off
//! deployments stay byte-identical to a relay built before this module
//! existed. When enabled, it:
//!
//! 1. binds the iroh endpoint on `BUZZ_MESH_BIND_ADDR` (boot-unique keypair =
//!    boot-unique `RuntimeId`),
//! 2. publishes a relay-key-attested [`ReadyRecord`] to the Redis ready
//!    registry and starts the readiness-gated heartbeat,
//! 3. starts the [`MeshRuntime`] loops (accept, reconcile/dial, gossip) and
//!    runs one immediate reconcile pass so seed peers are dialed at boot,
//! 4. spawns a drain watcher: when the relay's `shutting_down` flag flips,
//!    membership gossips `draining=true`, locally-owned huddle leases are
//!    generation-fenced drained, and the heartbeat clears the registry record.
//!
//! Consumers (huddle control plane, reliable-stream tunnels) reach the mesh
//! exclusively through [`MeshHandle`] via `AppState::mesh()` — `None` means
//! "behave exactly like a single-instance relay."
