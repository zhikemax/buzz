//! NIP-FI HTTP ingress enforcement.
//!
//! Every protected HTTP surface in enforce mode MUST call
//! [`admit_nip_fi_http`] (or its state-convenience wrapper
//! [`admit_nip_fi_http_on_state`]) which is the single authority for the
//! complete NIP-FI admission decision for one HTTP request:
//!
//! 1. Run the caller's NIP-98 extraction closure → `proven_pubkey`.
//! 2. Extract the `Nostr-Federated-Identity: Bearer <JWS>` assertion.
//! 3. Verify it offline against the configured issuer JWKS.
//! 4. Confirm the assertion's `nostr_pubkey` equals `proven_pubkey`. [FI-INV-05]
//! 5. Check the deny map for the proven pubkey. [FI-INV-14]
//!
//! HTTP is sessionless: every request re-verifies.  There is no lifetime-
//! partition concept — the session-bounds section of NIP-FI.md is WS-only.
//!
//! ## Structural authority
//!
//! [`NipFiAdmission`] has a private constructor.  The only way to produce
//! one is via [`admit_nip_fi_http`].  This does not force a handler to call
//! it.  In Enforce, a handler that skips the call and does its own NIP-98 is
//! still subject to the router's assertion guard, but a request with a valid
//! assertion passes without key pairing or a deny-map check.  (Off skips the
//! guard entirely; DenyProtected denies without verifying.)
//!
//! ## Carrier / precedence
//!
//! Per NIP-FI.md §Client-attached transport:
//! - Assertion: `Nostr-Federated-Identity: Bearer <compact-JWS>` (extracted
//!   and verified by [`crate::nip_fi_core`]).
//! - Nostr proof: `Authorization: Nostr <base64-event>` (NIP-98, owned by
//!   the NIP-98 closure passed to `admit_nip_fi_http`).
//! - `Authorization` is RESERVED for NIP-98; the assertion MUST NOT appear
//!   there.  Mixing the two fields is an `EvidenceRejected` (403) denial.
//!
//! ## Deny map
//!
//! HTTP admission reads the relay's single shared [`buzz_auth::NipFiDenyMap`]
//! (`AppState::nip_fi_deny_map`) — the same `Arc` the admin disconnect endpoint
//! writes and WebSocket admission reads — so one deny is enforced on every
//! ingress.
//!
//! ## Off-mode regression
//!
//! When `NipFiMode::Off`, `admit_nip_fi_http` still calls the NIP-98 closure
//! (preserving whatever auth the surface required before NIP-FI), then returns
//! `Ok(NipFiAdmission { assertion: None, ... })` immediately without the
//! assertion/pairing/deny steps.  Pre-NIP-FI behavior is fully preserved for
//! OSS deployments.
//!
//! [FI-TRACE-DENIAL-ORACLE]: exact HTTP response bytes are fixed in NIP-FI.md.
//! [FI-TRACE-TRANSPORT-CLOSED]: assertion transport is exactly one header.
//! [FI-TRACE-AUTHORITY-UNIFORM]: all protected surfaces call this function.

///    cardinality check, the NIP-98 closure, or the verifier run.
/// 2. Enforce mode: reject more than one `Authorization` field (403).
/// 3. Run `extract_nip98` — the caller's NIP-98 extraction closure.  Returns
///    `(proven_pubkey, X)` on success, or a `Response` to emit on failure.
///    Off and Shadow return `Ok(NipFiAdmission { proven_pubkey, assertion:
///    None, extra: X })` here, identical to pre-NIP-FI (no assertion
///    requirement); Shadow first records the verdict steps 4-7 would reach.
///    [FI-INV-15]
/// 4. Enforce mode: extract `Nostr-Federated-Identity: Bearer <JWS>`.
/// 5. Verify assertion (signature, issuer, expiry, claims).
/// 6. Assert `assertion.asserted_key == proven_pubkey`.  [FI-INV-05]
/// 7. Check deny map for `(iss, proven_pubkey)`.  [FI-INV-14]
/// 8. Return `Ok(NipFiAdmission { proven_pubkey, assertion: Some(...), extra: X })`.
///
/// ## NIP-98 failure remapping in Enforce mode
///
/// When the NIP-98 closure fails in Enforce mode, the closure typically returns
/// a legacy JSON 401/403 (`api_error`).  NIP-FI.md §Admission procedure step 3
/// requires NIP-FI DenialClass responses instead:
/// - Absent `Authorization` header → `MissingEvidence` (401 "authentication required")
/// - Present but malformed/invalid `Authorization` → `EvidenceRejected` (403)
///
/// In Off and Shadow the legacy response is returned unchanged ([FI-INV-15]).
/// [FI-TRACE-DENIAL-ORACLE]
///
/// ## What the private constructor guarantees
///
/// [`NipFiAdmission`] has a private constructor, so the only source of a
/// `NipFiAdmission` value is this function.  It does not force a handler to
/// call this function.  In Enforce, a handler that skips it and runs its own
/// NIP-98 is still subject to the router's assertion guard, but a request with
/// a valid assertion passes without key pairing or a deny-map check.  Off and
/// Shadow pass the guard unchanged; DenyProtected denies without verifying.
///
/// ## Off and Shadow semantics
///
/// In Off and Shadow the NIP-98 closure is always called (step 3) and its
/// result still gates entry — if NIP-98 auth is required for non-NIP-FI
/// reasons (e.g. `require_auth_token`), the closure encodes that.  The NIP-FI
/// layers (assertion/pairing/deny) never deny: Off skips them, Shadow
/// evaluates them only to record the would-be verdict.
///
