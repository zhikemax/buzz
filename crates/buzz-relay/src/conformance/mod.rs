//! Runtime conformance harness — the relay's side of the trace seam.
//!
//! This module hosts the [`Tracer`] re-export and the per-request emit
//! helpers that translate the relay's actual decisions into [`TraceStep`]s
//! from `buzz-conformance`. See `crates/buzz-conformance/src/lib.rs` for
//! the schema and `docs/spec/MultiTenantRelay.tla` for what the schema is
//! grounded in.
//!
//! ## Design rules (from `skill-runtime-formal-compliance`)
//!
//! 1. **Project, don't echo.** The trace carries opaque labels (community
//!    UUID, channel UUID, blake3-truncated actor) — never the event id,
//!    payload, pubkey bytes, signature, or wall-clock timestamps. The
//!    only fields that survive are the ones the spec's `Next` and
//!    `Inv_NonInterference` reason about.
//! 2. **Don't normalize away violations.** The emitter records
//!    `claimed_community` (from the event's `h` tag) SEPARATELY from
//!    `resolved_community` (from `TenantContext::community()`). The
//!    checker's M2 bite depends on seeing both.
//! 3. **Drop guard is load-bearing.** Every entry to a critical seam must
//!    construct an [`EmitGuard`]; if the seam exits without an emit, the
//!    guard's `Drop` records [`TraceAction::ImplBug`] which the checker
//!    treats as a coverage breach.
//!
//! ## Wire points
//!
//! - **ingest.rs:** AuthCheck at `check_channel_membership` call site;
//!   WriteInsert / WriteInsertGlobal / WriteDuplicate at the two
//!   `dispatch_persistent_event` sites; SanitizedError at the outer
//!   wrapper based on the IngestError variant.
//! - **req.rs / event.rs:** (held back as additive patch for Eva to apply
//!   onto Max's req.rs writes — see thread `c882c9b1…`).
