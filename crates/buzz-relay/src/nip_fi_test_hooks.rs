//! Test-only barriers for NIP-FI B2 witness tests.
//!
//! Each function is a named production hook that is inert in production
//! (`#[cfg(test)]` guards ensure zero-cost at runtime) but acts as a
//! deterministic barrier in tests. A test arms the gate, dispatches work,
//! waits for the arrived notification, fires expiry, then releases the gate.
//!
//! Pattern (same as `publish_test_hooks` in `side_effects.rs`):
//! - `arm(community)` → `(arrived_rx, release_notify)`
//! - Production code calls `before_X(community).await`
//! - Test awaits `arrived_rx.await` → knows production reached the hook
//! - Test fires expiry
//! - Test calls `release_notify.notify_one()` → production proceeds
//!
//! Only one gate per community-slot is supported at a time (static Mutex<HashMap>).
//! Tests using different communities can run concurrently — each gets its own gate.
//! Tests using the same community must not run concurrently (they will interfere).
//!
//! # Per-witness mutation-red table
//!

//! | **P1-a** (huddle-liveness REQ barrier) | same | Remove `acquire_effect()` from liveness branch | handler proceeds to `huddle_started_links` DB call → `liveness_query_counter` = 1 → `assert_eq!(count, 0)` panics |

//! | **W6** (audio B1 mid-admission) | `audio/handler.rs`, biased `cancel.cancelled()` in auth select | Remove `_ = cancel.cancelled() => return` | handler proceeds to auth exchange; close assertion fires on 3s timeout |
//! | **B1-pre-auth** (audio already-expired pre-auth fast path) | `audio/handler.rs` — synchronous fast-path before NIP-42 challenge | Remove pre-auth already-expired block | challenge sent before denial → first received message is Text challenge → restricted frame never arrives → timeout panics |

//! | **P2-verify-fence** (audio verify_auth_event cancel fence) | `audio/handler.rs` — biased `select!` around `verify_auth_event` | Remove the select (bare `.await`) | verify completes post-cancel → pairing bookkeeping reached → `pairing_reached_after_cancel` counter > 0 → assertion panics |

//! | **W9** (audio participant-commit barrier) | same | Remove `tx.rollback()` from `SessionExpired` branch | sqlx rolls back on drop regardless — mutation does NOT change test outcome (explicit rollback is belt-and-suspenders); covered by W9C instead |
//! | **W9** (audio participant-commit barrier) | same | Remove `acquire_effect()` entirely | commit proceeds despite cancel — row committed — row-count assertion panics |
//! | **W10** (concurrent committers, different pubkeys) | same as W9 | Delete `before_participant_commit(...)` call | `arrived_rx` times out — test panics |

//! | **CW5** (AutoAddRequired joint-tx rollback) | same | Change `membership_admission` to `Existing` | auto-add path never entered; membership seam not covered — test fails at isolation |
//! | **CW5-variant** (concurrent external membership add) | `audio/handler.rs` — `before_membership_lock` fires inside the `AutoAddRequired` branch immediately before the channel membership lock | Delete `before_membership_lock(...)` call | `arrived_rx` times out — test panics |
//! | **CW5-variant** (concurrent external membership add) | same | Remove the `still_absent` re-read and always insert | external membership may be double-written (ON CONFLICT behaviour) — re-read path is the contract seam; removing it bypasses the contract |
//! | **CW5-variant** (concurrent external membership add) | same | Remove the `if still_absent { insert }` guard | same as above — auto-add fires unconditionally alongside the external row |
//! | **CW8** (post-add_peer cancel → cleanup) | `audio/handler.rs` — `after_add_peer` fires immediately after `room.add_peer` succeeds and before `check_cancel!(cleanup:...)` | Delete `after_add_peer(...)` call | `arrived_rx` times out — test panics |
//! | **CW8** (post-add_peer cancel → cleanup) | same | Delete `room.remove_peer(peer_id)` from cleanup block | room is non-empty — `room.is_empty()` assertion panics |
//! | **CW8** (post-add_peer cancel → cleanup) | same | Move `after_add_peer` hook to before `room.add_peer` | cancel fires before add_peer — check_cancel! exits without cleanup arm — room empty but hook fired at wrong seam |
//! | **CW10** (commit-won/quiescence: expiry blocked at barrier) | `audio/handler.rs` — `after_participant_fanout` fires after `tx.commit()` + fan-out, before `_permit` drops | Delete `after_participant_fanout(...)` call | `arrived_rx` times out — test panics |
//! | **CW10** (commit-won/quiescence: expiry blocked at barrier) | same | Remove `acquire_effect()` from `commit_participant_join` | permit never held — expiry completes before hook fires — `expire_done` is true before check — "expiry must be blocked" assertion panics |
//! | **CW10-full** (full-handler lifecycle: committed join → exactly one 48102) | `audio/handler.rs` — full `handle_active_audio_connection` via WS; hook at `after_participant_fanout`, then disconnect triggers normal teardown | Remove `emit_participant_event(48102, ...)` from handler epilogue | 48102 count stays 0 — assertion panics |
//! | **CW10-full** (full-handler lifecycle) | same | Remove `room.remove_peer_and_check_ended` from teardown | room entry persists — `audio_rooms.get()` returns Some — room assertion panics |
//! | **CW6** (guard-level: unattached lease released on pre-commit exit) | `audio/handler.rs` — `HuddleAdmissionGuard::release_before_commit` with injected `CountingDir` double (no Redis/mesh required) | Remove `if let Some((lease, directory)) = self.lease.take()` block from `release_before_commit` | `directory.release()` never called — `release_calls` stays 0 — assertion panics |
//! | **CW6** (guard-level: unattached lease released on pre-commit exit) | same | Short-circuit `release_before_commit` to return immediately before the lease block | same as above — `release_calls` stays 0 — assertion panics |
//! | **CW7** (guard-level: clean close sent on remote stream pre-commit exit) | `audio/handler.rs` — `HuddleAdmissionGuard::release_before_commit` with injected `RecordingSend` stub MeshStream + `RemoteHuddleSession::for_test` | Remove `if let (Some(session), Some(ref mut stream)) = ...` block from `release_before_commit` | `send_frame` never called — `goodbye_sent` is false — assertion panics |
//! | **CW7** (guard-level: clean close sent on remote stream pre-commit exit) | same | Swap `UnregisterPeer` and `Goodbye` frame order in `send_clean_close` | frames recorded in wrong order — assertion on Goodbye position panics |
//!
//! # Teardown ordering (quiescence citations)
//!
//! The quiescence requirement from the contract (e5bc0382): the expiry task must complete
//! (i.e., acquire and release the write guard after cancellation) before subscription/peer
//! cleanup runs. This prevents post-`remove_connection` subscription leaks.
//!
//! **Root WS** (`connection.rs:449-453`):
//! ```text
//! if let Some(task) = nip_fi_expiry_task { let _ = task.await; }  // line 449
//! for removed in state.sub_registry.remove_connection(...)  // line 453 — after expiry
//! ```
//!
//! **Audio WS** (`audio/handler.rs:1128-1138`):
//! ```text
//! if let Some(expiry_task) = nip_fi_audio_expiry_task { let _ = expiry_task.await; }  // line 1128
//! room.remove_peer_and_check_ended(peer_id)  // line 1138 — after expiry
//! ```
//!
//! **Pre-existing cleanup helpers** (audio expiry path):
//! - `send_clean_close` (`audio/join.rs`) — sends WS close frame for remote session path
//! - `cleanup_if_empty` (`audio/rooms.rs`) — removes room when peer count drops to zero
//! - `room.remove_peer` (`audio/room.rs`) — removes peer from in-memory room roster
