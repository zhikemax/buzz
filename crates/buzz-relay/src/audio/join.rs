//! Cross-pod huddle join coordination over the mesh `HuddleControl` profile.
//!
//! This is the control plane that decides, at join time, *which pod owns a
//! huddle* and wires a client into that owner's room — the counterpart to the
//! media datagram fan-out in [`super::mesh`]. It is the join path
//! [`super::handler`] calls once a client has authed and passed membership.
//!
//! ## Ownership decision (Redis is the arbiter, mesh is only a hint)
//!
//! A huddle's `session_id` is its `channel_id`. Exactly one pod owns it: the
//! holder of the Redis fenced CAS lease. On join we resolve ownership through
//! the [`HuddleDirectory`]:
//!
//! - **No live lease** → this pod acquires it and becomes owner
//!   ([`JoinOutcome::LocalOwner`]). The client admits to a local [`Room`] as in
//!   a single-pod huddle.
//! - **Lease held by us** → [`JoinOutcome::LocalOwner`] at the live generation.
//! - **Lease held by another pod** → [`JoinOutcome::RemoteOwner`]. The client
//!   admits to a *local* room too, but the pod also opens a `HuddleControl`
//!   stream to the owner and registers the client as a remote peer there so the
//!   owner fans media back (see [`super::mesh`]).
//!
//! Membership never grants ownership: it may say "route to that pod," never
//! "take over." The owner side re-validates every registration's fence against
//! Redis on receipt — fencing at every hop, not just at the origin — so a lease
//! that changes between our lookup and the owner's receipt is caught there.
//!
//! ## `HuddleControl` payload schema (owned here)
//!
//! The mesh wire layer carries huddle-control bytes opaquely in
//! [`MeshStreamFrame::Data`](buzz_relay_mesh::MeshStreamFrame). Their layout is
//! [`HuddleControlMsg`], postcard-encoded. Non-owner → owner:
//! [`HuddleControlMsg::RegisterPeer`] / [`HuddleControlMsg::UnregisterPeer`].
//! Owner → non-owner: [`HuddleControlMsg::PeerRegistered`] (assigned index) or
//! [`HuddleControlMsg::RegisterRejected`] (fence/admission failure surfaced to
//! the client as a join error, never a silent media drop).

// ── Owner-side HuddleControl accept path ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The owner pod hosts the real [`Room`]. When a *non-owner* pod opens a
// `HuddleControl` stream and registers a client, the owner admits that client
// as an ordinary [`AudioPeer`] whose `audio_tx` is drained by
// [`super::mesh::spawn_remote_peer_sink`] back to the non-owner pod as
// datagrams. `Room` never learns about the mesh — a remote participant looks
// exactly like a local one to fan-out.

/// Owner-side handler for inbound `HuddleControl` streams.
///
/// One instance per relay; the boot-seam dispatcher routes every
/// `Profile::HuddleControl` session stream to [`Self::accept_inbound`]. It is
/// the counterpart to Perci's reliable-stream acceptor — same
/// `accept_inbound(from, hello, stream)` shape, different profile and body.
/// The community is not a handshake parameter: it rides the first stateful
/// frame and is self-verified by the fence (see [`Self::serve_control_loop`]).
