//! Cross-pod huddle audio: owner fan-out over the relay mesh.
//!
//! Today a huddle's audio only fans out within a single pod
//! ([`super::room::Room::broadcast_frame`]). Under horizontal scaling, two
//! participants can land on different pods and never hear each other — which is
//! why [`super::handler`] rejects joins with `huddle_audio_unavailable` when the
//! deployment sets `huddle_audio_available = false`. This module removes that
//! wall by routing audio across the mesh to the pod that *owns* the huddle.
//!
//! ## Owner-authoritative model
//!
//! One pod owns a huddle: the holder of the Redis fenced CAS lease for
//! `session_id == channel_id` (the session directory, Perci's lane, exposed to
//! us through [`HuddleOwnerDirectory`]). That pod hosts the single
//! [`Room`](super::room::Room) —
//! the sole allocator of the 0..=254 `peer_index` space, so indices can never
//! collide across pods. Non-owner pods are thin: they register their local
//! clients as *remote peers* in the owner's room over a reliable
//! [`Profile::HuddleControl`] stream, forward those clients' Opus frames to the
//! owner as datagrams, and deliver the owner's fan-out back verbatim.
//!
//! ## The payload invariant (why this needs no wire change)
//!
//! Protocol v1/v2 clients send an opaque client frame and receive the released
//! one-byte `[peer_index]` routing prefix. Protocol v3 adds a per-index `epoch`,
//! so its relay-added prefix is `[peer_index][epoch]`. The relay parses v2/v3
//! frame headers for telemetry only and otherwise forwards client bytes opaquely.
//! Both prefix shapes are routing metadata — they never touch ciphertext — and
//! map directly onto [`MeshDatagram::payload`]. **peer_index is always the first
//! byte of a media datagram payload, both directions**; the remainder is the
//! versioned opaque wire frame and rides unchanged through the split-and-reprefix
//! below. The client's WebSocket wire format stays byte-identical to single-pod
//! fan-out.
//!
//! ## Room stays pure
//!
//! `Room` never learns about the mesh. A remote participant is an ordinary
//! [`AudioPeer`] whose `audio_tx` receiver is drained by a task that wraps each
//! frame in a [`MeshDatagram`] and calls [`RelayPeerTransport::send_datagram`].
//! The in-pod fan-out is reused unchanged; only a peer's *sink* differs.
//!
//! ## Fencing (law, not exempt for media)
//!
//! Every datagram carries a [`FencedHeader`]. Both ends reject frames whose
//! generation is stale for the session — a late datagram from a dead generation
//! is dropped, which for lossy audio is indistinguishable from packet loss and
//! is therefore exactly correct. Monotonicity of `generation` across owner death
//! is guaranteed by the directory's companion INCR counter (session-directory
//! lane); this module trusts that and only enforces "reject < known".
