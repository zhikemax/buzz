//! Multi-tenant conformance harness.
//!
//! This file mirrors the obligation table in `docs/multi-tenant-conformance.md`
//! **one row per module**. It is the executable form of the conformance
//! contract: the current single-community relay is the wire-parity *oracle*, and
//! these tests prove two things the rewrite must never break:
//!
//!   1. **N=1 parity** — with one configured host → one default community, every
//!      existing client observes byte-identical behavior. This is asserted by the
//!      *existing* e2e suites (`e2e_relay`, `e2e_media`, `e2e_git`, …) run
//!      with `RELAY_URL` pointed at the new relay; no new test is needed here,
//!      only the documented obligation that those suites stay green unchanged.
//!
//!   2. **A/B isolation** — with two hosts → two communities on the *same* relay
//!      deployment, no tenant-observable state crosses the boundary. These are
//!      the new tests below. They require a running multi-tenant relay with two
//!      host mappings, so they are `#[ignore]` by default and selected with
//!      `--ignored`.
//!
//! # Running the A/B isolation suite
//!
//! ```text
//! RELAY_URL_A=http://a.localhost:3000 \
//! RELAY_URL_B=http://b.localhost:3000 \
//! cargo test -p buzz-test-client --test conformance_multitenant -- --ignored
//! ```
//!
//! Both URLs MUST address the same relay process (same pod, same Postgres, same
//! Redis); only the `Host` header differs. That is the whole point: one binary,
//! one DB, two communities, provably isolated by `community_id` derived from the
//! host — never from caller input.
//!
//! # Status of each row
//!
//! A row is `todo!()`-stubbed until the lane it depends on lands on the
//! integration branch. The stub is intentional and load-bearing: it names the
//! exact obligation so the lane owner fills in *their* row, and a green run can
//! never be faked by an empty body. Lane ownership is noted per module.

mod audit_log {
    //! Obligation: audit reads verify exactly one community chain
    //! (`(community_id, seq)` / `(community_id, hash)`); error strings must not
    //! leak cross-community IDs, constraint names, or existence facts.
    //!
    //! **This row is doc-only — and that is the strongest statement in the file.**
    //!
    //! Every other row here proves a black-box property: the relay serves a wire
    //! response, and the test asserts that response denies a cross-community
    //! oracle. The audit log has no such response to assert against — it has **no
    //! client-reachable wire surface at all**. There is no `/audit` route in
    //! `crates/buzz-relay/src/router.rs` (the route list is `/`, `/info`,
    //! `/.well-known/nostr.json`, the health probes, `/events`, `/query`,
    //! `/count`, `/hooks`, the media and git sub-routers, and the audio WS — no
    //! audit endpoint). Audit is written as an ingest side-effect
    //! (`handlers/event.rs`, `dispatch_persistent_event`) and read only via
    //! `buzz_audit::AuditService::{verify_chain, get_entries}`, which are
    //! operator-internal (consumed by `buzz-admin`). `crates/buzz-audit/src/
    //! error.rs` states it directly: `AuditError` is "never relayed to a client
    //! on the wire," and "no variant embeds a `community_id`."
    //!
    //! So where other rows prove *the oracle is denied*, audit proves *the
    //! oracle's surface does not exist* — a strictly stronger isolation claim,
    //! and the honest way to state it is to cite the facts, not to invent a wire
    //! observation that the architecture does not offer. Reaching behind the
    //! wire into Postgres here would also break this file's black-box contract
    //! (its deps are `buzz-ws-client`/`reqwest`/`tokio-tungstenite`/`s3` — no
    //! `sqlx`, no `buzz-audit`), and a DB-direct read can never catch a
    //! wire-layer bug because it never traverses the wire read path.
    //!
    //! The two halves of the obligation are proven in their proper homes, where
    //! direct Postgres access is in-convention:
    //!
    //!   1. **One chain per community** —
    //!      `buzz_audit::service::tests::chains_are_independent_per_community`
    //!      (direct `AuditService::log`) proves interleaved A/B writes keep
    //!      independent `(community_id, seq)` chains, each starting at seq 1 with
    //!      its own `prev_hash`, and that `verify_chain`/`get_entries` scoped to
    //!      one community never traverse another. The *integrated* path — that a
    //!      community resolved from the request's `TenantContext` at relay ingest
    //!      lands in the correct chain and stays isolated — is proven by
    //!      `buzz_relay::handlers::event::tests::
    //!      audit_chain_is_isolated_per_tenant_through_relay_ingest`, driving
    //!      `dispatch_persistent_event` under two tenants against a shared
    //!      Postgres (no WS-AUTH dependency).
    //!   2. **Errors don't leak** —
    //!      `buzz_audit::error::tests::audit_error_text_carries_no_community_id_or_constraint`
    //!      asserts no `AuditError` variant's rendered text embeds a
    //!      `community_id`, constraint name, or cross-community object id.
    //!
    //! Substrate on PR head: `crates/buzz-audit/src/entry.rs` keys `AuditEntry`
    //! `(community_id, seq)` with per-community `prev_hash`; `NewAuditEntry.
    //! community_id` is typed `CommunityId` (server-resolved, never client
    //! input).
