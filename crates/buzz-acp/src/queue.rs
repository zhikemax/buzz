//! Event queue state machine for buzz-acp.
//!
//! Manages per-channel event queues with per-channel in-flight tracking.
//! When the harness is ready to prompt the agent, it flushes the channel with
//! the oldest pending event, draining ALL events for that channel into a single
//! batch. Multiple channels can be in-flight simultaneously; each channel is
//! independent.
//!
//! ## Dedup modes
//!
//! - **Drop** (default) — while a prompt is in-flight for channel C, new events
//!   for channel C are silently dropped (debug-logged). Events for other channels
//!   still queue normally.
//! - **Queue** — all events accumulate; batched on the next flush cycle.
