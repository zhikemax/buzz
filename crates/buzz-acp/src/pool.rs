    // Core memory is delivered inside the system prompt the harness already

    // modern agents, the fetch must run *before* the session is created — so
    // we do it here and cache the rendered section in `state.core_sections`.
    //
    // Core is keyed by (agent_keys, owner) — both fixed for the process — so
    // it is identical across channels; the per-channel cache just avoids a
    // re-fetch on each new session and is cleared on session invalidation.
    //
    // Failure modes (all fail open — no crash, no block):
    //   * no owner configured → skip (no NIP-AE namespace exists)
    //   * confirmed absence → cache the onboarding nudge so the agent
    //     learns how to bootstrap itself.
    //   * transport / decrypt / parse error → inject nothing. We never
    //     mistake "relay slow or broken" for "no core" — that would invite
    //     the agent to overwrite real, just-unreachable memory.
    //   * fetch exceeds CORE_FETCH_TIMEOUT → inject nothing, same reason.
    //
    // Per Tyler's locked spec: NO mid-session refreshes. Re-fetch only
    // happens when a session is invalidated and recreated (see
