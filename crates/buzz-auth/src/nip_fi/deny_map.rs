//! In-memory NIP-FI deny set.
//!
//! Holds `(iss, pubkey) → until` entries.  No persistence — a relay restart
//! forgets active entries (Option B, as decided).  The issuer re-push path is
//! documented as the mitigation but is not implemented here.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! * **Merge rule**: inserting a new `until` for an existing key retains
//!   `max(existing_until, new_until)` — an accepted disconnect MUST NOT shorten
//!   an active deny. [FI-TRACE-DENY-SET]
//! * **Past-`until` commands**: close sessions but MUST NOT create or shorten
//!   entries.  Concretely, when `new_until < now` the merge still applies the
//!   `max` rule, which preserves any active entry and lets a "no active entry"
//!   case insert with an already-expired value (immediately inactive). [FI-TRACE-DENY-SET]
//! * **Per-issuer capacity cap**: each issuer has a hard ceiling on live entries.
//!   A capacity failure returns `Err(DenySetFull)` without inserting anything —
//!   the spec requires `503` here and neither the jti nor the deny entry is
//!   recorded. [FI-TRACE-DENY-SET]
//! * **Cross-issuer isolation**: capacity of issuer A MUST NOT affect issuer B.
//! * **Cross-pod capacity miss**: `merge_cross_pod_deny` returning `CapacityExceeded`
//!   preserves the existing shard contents; the caller closes the delivered
//!   target's sessions and reports/metrics the outcome.  No issuer-wide denial
//!   is synthesized.  Async propagation loss with issuer re-push is the
//!   sanctioned recovery. [NIP-FI.md:306-336]
//! * **jti reservation** and **deny-entry insertion** are both-or-neither.
//!   [`NipFiDenyMap::reserve`] runs every fallible check and holds a pending
//!   slot against both budgets; [`Reservation::commit`] then cannot fail, and
//!   dropping an uncommitted [`Reservation`] frees the slot.  The command
//!   verifier takes the cross-pod claim between the two. [VerifyCommandJwt step 7]
//! * **Issuer-global scope**: the deny applies across all communities served
//!   under that issuer. [FI-TRACE-DENY-SET]
//! * **Self-eviction**: expired entries and jtis are pruned on write, only when
//!   the shard is at capacity, so the map stays bounded without putting an
//!   O(n) sweep on every write.  Reads compare against `now`, so a lingering
//!   expired entry or jti is never treated as active.
