//! Git repository name registry (NIP-34 kind:30617).
//!
//! The relay holds no persistent per-repo filesystem state: git reads and
//! writes hydrate an ephemeral bare repo from object storage per request, and
//! writer serialization is the object-store pointer CAS (see
//! `docs/git-on-object-storage.md`, `Inv_NoFork`). Repo-*name* uniqueness is
//! the one remaining shared-state need, and it lives here — in Postgres, not on
//! local disk — so the relay is stateless and can run multiple replicas without
//! a ReadWriteMany volume.
//!
//! Names are unique **within a community**: the primary key is
//! `(community_id, repo_id)`, matching the multi-tenant invariant that every
//! tenant-scoped key leads with `community_id`. The PK enforces uniqueness
//! atomically via `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, which replaces the old
//! filesystem `create_dir` race guard. `owner_pubkey` distinguishes an
//! idempotent re-announce (same owner) from a collision (different owner), and
//! backs the per-pubkey quota via `COUNT`.
