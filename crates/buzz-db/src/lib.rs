//! buzz-db — Postgres event store for Buzz.
//!
//! ## Design invariants
//! - AUTH events (kind 22242) are never stored — they carry bearer tokens.
//! - Ephemeral events (20000–29999) are never stored — Redis pub/sub only.
//! - Events table is partitioned by month on `created_at`.
//! - No FK references to partitioned tables.
//! - Uses `sqlx::query()` (runtime) not `sqlx::query!()` (compile-time).
//!
//! ## Runtime and store ownership
//! Database runtime infrastructure and domain persistence are physically
//! separated behind this crate-root compatibility facade:
//!
//! - Runtime concerns own pool construction, writer/replica routing,
//!   transactions, sessions, metrics, health support, and migrations.
//! - Store concerns own domain-specific SQL, row mapping, locking, mutation
//!   rules, indexes, and focused persistence tests.
//!
//! Existing crate-root modules, records, and [`Db`] methods remain the public
//! API. The internal `runtime` and `store` namespaces are not public APIs.
