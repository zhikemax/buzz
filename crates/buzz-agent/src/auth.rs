//! Token sources for the LLM transport layer.
//!
//! [`TokenSource`] decouples request auth from `Config::api_key`: providers
//! can supply a static string ([`StaticTokenSource`]) or a refreshable OAuth
//! 2.0 PKCE engine ([`PkceOAuthTokenSource`]). Engines own their own cache
//! and refresh logic; the [`Llm`] just asks for a bearer per request.
//!
//! The PKCE engine implements RFC 6749 + RFC 7636 with on-disk token
//! caching keyed by `sha256(discovery_url|client_id|scopes)`. It's the
//! same shape goose uses for Databricks, but we own the wire format and
//! cache directory so the two are independently upgradable.
//!
//! First-use (cache empty) requires a browser: the engine opens
//! `authorization_endpoint` in `webbrowser`, listens on `127.0.0.1:0`,
//! captures the redirect, and exchanges the code for a token. Subsequent
//! calls hit the cache and silently refresh when expired.
