-- Report-less ("direct") staff actions: ban, timeout, or delete taken from the
-- admin console without a report. A direct row has report_id NULL; the
-- composite report FK is not enforced for it (MATCH SIMPLE), and
-- report_community_id remains the tenant the action applies to.
--
-- enforcement_target_event_id: the deleted event (direct delete).
-- timeout_secs: the client-requested timeout duration, compared on idempotent
--   retry; timeout_until stays the authoritative expiry fixed at acceptance.
