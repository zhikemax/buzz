-- Private accessory read progress. Never included in Nostr event queries.
-- A frontier is the relay arrival time (events.received_at) of the message a
-- context was read through, never signed event time, which the sender chooses.
-- An empty root_id covers only the channel timeline; a root-specific frontier
-- covers that thread, without inheritance.
-- threads_through_timestamp is the only cross-context cut: an explicit
-- whole-channel read that also covers every thread in that channel.
