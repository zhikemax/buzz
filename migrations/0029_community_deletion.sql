-- Durable, CLI-only whole-community deletion control plane.

-- The community row is never removed: it becomes the permanent name tombstone.
-- All destructive progress is lease/fence/checkpoint guarded and every existing
-- community-scoped table receives the same database-enforced write fence.
-- This migration intentionally remains one atomic catalog change so a failed
-- deployment cannot expose only a subset of the universal fences. CREATE
-- TRIGGER takes SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE on each target; fail quickly rather than
-- queueing behind long transactions. See the chart deletion rollout runbook.
