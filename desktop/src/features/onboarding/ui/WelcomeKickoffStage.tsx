 * (`bottom-full` = feet on the banner's top edge) and purely decorative —
 * the banner's own copy carries the setup status for screen readers.
 *
 * Placeholder choreography: staggered rise-from-below entrance per character
 * (CSS `motion-kickoff-character-enter`, delay via `--stagger-index`), whole
 * row crossfades out on either resolution — the first agent message landing,
 * or the wait timing out. The characters must not linger after a timeout: a
 * stage that stays up implies a team is still coming when none is.
