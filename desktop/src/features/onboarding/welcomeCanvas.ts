This private channel is your home base for getting oriented. Fizz, Honey, and Pollen can help you learn the app, troubleshoot setup, and work through something you are building.

## Work with your agents

- Mention an agent when you want its help.
- Bring multiple agents into the same conversation when you want different perspectives.
- Keep decisions, progress, and results in the channel so everyone shares the same context.

## Try something

Bring the team something you are building, or give them a quick challenge to see how they work together.

## Get help

Ask the team a question here, or read the [Buzz user guide](https://github.com/block/buzz#readme).
