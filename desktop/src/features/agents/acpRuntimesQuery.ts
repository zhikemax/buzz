 * retryable error if it failed, instead of authoritative. It is process-global
 * (one launch), so `startBootWarm` runs the warm exactly once no matter how many
 * times `AppShell` mounts — that also fixes the per-remount re-fire.
 *
 * The seam that protects onboarding (which renders before `AppShell` fires the
 * warm): the gate only overlays loading/error once the warm has *started*
 * (`pending`/`failed`). While `idle` — no warm yet, e.g. the onboarding flow —
 * cheap consumers behave exactly as before. A successful forced refresh from any

 * - `idle`/`settled` pass the query through unchanged, so onboarding (which
