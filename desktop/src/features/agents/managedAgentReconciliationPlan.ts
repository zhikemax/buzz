 * hook (which only re-ran on a community switch or relaunch) it must:
 *   - reconcile a newly configured relay as soon as it appears, without
 *     depending on the add flow also switching communities, and
 *   - retry a relay whose reconcile failed (relay unreachable at launch, laptop
 *     waking from sleep) with a capped backoff instead of leaving it un-spawned
 *     until the next switch or relaunch.
 *
 * These decisions live here with no React/timer/IPC dependencies so they can be
 * unit-tested directly; the hook only owns the refs, timer, and IPC calls.
