 * Resolve the provider and env-vars to PERSIST on Save.
 *
 * This dialog edits an agent INSTANCE's own fields (`record.provider`/
 * `record.env_vars`), which remain the source of truth for a definition-less
 * (legacy) instance and for any local/display state before the next resolve.
 * For a LINKED instance, spawn/deploy resolve the effective provider/model
 * from the definition, never from the record's own `provider`/`model` bytes
 * (see `effective_config::resolve_effective_config` on the desktop backend) —
 * so persisting `record.provider` here only matters for definition-less
 * instances and for keeping the record's display/legacy fields consistent;
 * it does not change what a linked instance spawns with.
 *
 * The one case this function still has to handle carefully is the
 * inherit-TRANSITION-from-a-harness-pin: a previously harness-pinned agent
 * (e.g. Claude — `agent.agentCommandOverride != null` at dialog open) has its
 * `provider` cleared and carries no persona credential, then the user checks
 * "Inherit runtime from template" for a provider-backed persona (e.g.
 * buzz-agent/Anthropic). Persisting the local (empty) provider + credential-
 * less env would leave a definition-less instance's record fields blank.
 * Only in that case — inheriting AND the local provider is empty AND the agent
 * was harness-pinned at open — do we substitute the persona snapshot: the
 * persona's provider and the persona-layered env (`{ ...personaEnv,
 * ...agentEnv }`, agent layer wins to mirror spawn-time layering).
 *
 * A NON-empty local provider while inheriting (e.g. an Anthropic-persona agent
 * the user re-points to Databricks) is a deliberate edit and passes through
 * unchanged — we never overwrite it with the persona provider.
 *
 * MODEL follows the same transition rule. buzz-agent/goose readiness requires a
 * model, but a Claude-pinned agent's record often carries no model (Claude
 * resolves its own). On the inherit-transition to a provider-backed persona with
 * a set `persona.model`, persisting the empty local model would save a
 * record-level model gap — so we substitute `personaModel` in that same case. A
 * non-empty local model (deliberate pick) always passes through; an empty local
 * model in steady state stays empty (runtime default), same authoritative
 * logic.
 *
 * An EMPTY local provider while inheriting on an agent that was ALREADY
 * inheriting at open (`agentWasHarnessPinned` false) is ALSO authoritative: the
 * user either never set one or deliberately picked the "Default" option to
 * clear a saved override, so we persist `null` (runtime default) rather than
 * resurrect the persona provider — otherwise the Default option could never
 * actually clear an inherited agent's provider override.
 *
 * Provider is normalized: trimmed, empty → `null`.
