/**
 * Behavior tests for the inline "Add custom harness…" dropdown entry shared by
 * AgentDefinitionDialog and AgentInstanceEditDialog.
 *
 * Two seams carry the feature, and both are pinned here:
 *
 *   1. ROUTING (`runtimeDropdownAction`) — the sentinel must resolve to "open
 *      the form", never to a selection. If it ever resolved to a selection the
 *      dialogs would write "\u0000add-custom-harness" into `runtime` and try to
 *      spawn an agent on a harness that does not exist.
 *   2. DEFERRED SELECTION (`usePendingHarnessSelection`) — saving only writes
 *      the definition file; the harness becomes a catalog entry when the
 *      invalidated discovery query refetches. Selecting on save would pick an
 *      id no entry backs. The hook must wait for the catalog, fire exactly
 *      once, stay silent when the user cancels, and drop the pending id when
 *      its dialog closes — the host dialogs stay mounted, so a stale id would
 *      otherwise select into reset form state on a later publish.
 *
 * The hook is mounted for real (react-dom/client + act) rather than simulated,
 * so its effect wiring — including the guard that survives the dialogs'
 * non-memoized change handlers — is what gets tested.
