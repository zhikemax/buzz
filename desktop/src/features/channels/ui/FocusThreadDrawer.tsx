 * opacity covers 100% of its range while transform covers ~3% of the drawer's
 * width, the fade is what the eye reads. Resolving opacity in the first ~90ms
 * leaves the remaining ~190ms as pure travel: the fade is over before it
 * registers, and what's perceived is sliding.
 *

 * so its only job is to get out of the way without popping. That makes duration
 * the thing to spend, and 140ms is about the floor before the drawer reads as
 * vanishing rather than leaving.
 *
 * The opacity hold shrinks with it. Its purpose is to let the drawer commit to
