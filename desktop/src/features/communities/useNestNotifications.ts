/**
 * Surface nest-related backend events as toasts.
 *
 * - `repos-dir-error`: a configured `repos_dir` failed to validate or its
 *   symlink could not be applied (invalid path, downgrade refused, external
 *   target gone). Emitted by `apply_workspace` on both the validate-reject
 *   and the runtime symlink-failure paths, so a bad `repos_dir` is always
 *   visibly surfaced rather than silently logged to console.
 * - `legacy-nest-migrated`: the agent's knowledge was carried over from a
 *   legacy `~/.sprout` nest. Shown once per machine (deduped via
 *   localStorage); the backend re-emits each launch while `~/.sprout` exists,
 *   which also covers the event being emitted before this listener mounts.
 *
 * Mounted at the app root ahead of the community-init effect so the listener
 * is registered before the first `apply_workspace` call.
