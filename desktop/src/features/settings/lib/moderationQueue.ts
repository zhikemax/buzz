// Domain logic for the community-moderation admin queue (U2 admin surface).
//
// Pure, hook-free transforms over the NIP-98 `/moderation/*` read contract so
// they can be unit-tested without a relay. The authoritative wire row shapes
// live in `@/shared/api/moderation` (Dawn's lane); this module owns only the
// triage math: severity ordering, grouping by target, and prior-actions
// correlation. It reuses those row types directly, narrowing just the two
// fields the triage math dispatches on (`reportType`, `status`) to the precise
// unions below — the shared types keep them as `string` so the wire can carry
// values the client doesn't yet model.
//
// Privacy invariant (locked, Tyler 2026-07-07): `reporterPubkey` is visible in
// this admin queue but MUST NEVER reach any surface the reported author can
// see. Nothing here is rendered author-side.

 * - `escalate` / `dismiss` are decision-only and always available.
