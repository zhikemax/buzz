/**
 * Owns the draft-persist lifecycle for `MessageComposer`.
 *
 * This hook:
 * - Holds `pendingImetaForPersistRef` — the ref the cleanup reads when
 *   persisting `pendingImeta` to the draft store.
 * - Updates that ref on every render (render-time passive path) so normal
 *   add/remove-image operations are always captured.
 * - Runs a `useEffect` keyed on `effectiveDraftKey` that restores a saved
 *   draft into the composer (content + imeta + spoilered urls) or clears it,
 *   and whose cleanup persists the outgoing draft before the key changes.
 *
 * **The StrictMode fix lives here.**
 * When the restore effect body calls `setPendingImeta(saved.pendingImeta)`,
 * that state update is async — it won't commit until React re-renders.
 * React StrictMode (dev builds) simulates an unmount immediately after the
 * effect body, before the re-render. Without the synchronous write the
 * cleanup would read `[]` and overwrite the just-restored images.
 *
 * The effect body calls `snapshotPendingImeta` (the synchronous ref write)
 * BEFORE `setPendingImeta`, so the cleanup always sees the correct value.
 *
 * Extracted from `MessageComposer` so the full lifecycle can be exercised
 * directly in a StrictMode test without mounting the full composer.
