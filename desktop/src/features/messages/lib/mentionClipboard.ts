 *  - `text/html` — the same content, with each mention wrapped in a span
 *    carrying its pubkey. Pasting back into a Buzz composer harvests those
 *    records, registers `name → pubkey` with the mention machinery, and the
 *    chip re-lights with the exact tagged identity.
 *
 * The wrapper marker declares what the *plain* flavor holds so paste knows
 * which content path to use — see `BuzzCopyKind`.

 *
 * - `full` — the text carries the whole label, allowing for what a legitimate
 *   chip picks up in transit: Buzz's copy handlers write the sigil into the
 *   text, `buildMentionSpanHtml` keeps the author's casing over the label's,
 *   and a pasteboard round trip can swap spaces for U+00A0.
 * - `truncated` — the text is the ellipsized form `truncateInlineChipLabel`
 *   renders for a label past the inline-chip cap. A *fully* selected long chip
 *   carries this rather than the label, so treating it as a fragment would
 *   strip the identity off every copy of a long channel reference and drop the
 *   whole selection back to the browser's dead-text default.
 * - `fragment` — anything else: the slice a boundary-crossing selection leaves
 *   behind. It must neither regain a sigil nor keep an identity, so that a
 *   paste can never bind a real pubkey to a partial name.
 *
 * Deliberately not an equality test against the rendered text: a chip that
 * grows any text of its own (a badge, a glyph's text fallback) must not
 * silently reclassify every chip as a fragment. Text a chip adds *beyond* its
 * label still reads as `fragment` — the safe direction, since that costs a
 * copy its identity rather than inventing one.
