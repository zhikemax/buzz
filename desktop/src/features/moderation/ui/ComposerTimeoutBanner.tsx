/**
 * A banner docked to the top edge of the composer while the member is timed
 * out by community moderators. Shows a live countdown when the expiry is known;
 * otherwise states the block without a timer (the relay gave no timestamp).
 *
 * Owns the timeout's per-second tick via {@link useTimeoutState}, so the
 * interval and the clear-at-expiry effect are scoped to this banner's lifetime.
 * Mount it behind {@link useTimeoutActive}: it renders only while a timeout is
 * active, the tick runs exactly while the countdown is on screen, and at expiry
 * the hook's effect clears the store — flipping the flag and unmounting this.
