 * connection, and a timeout blocks every channel's writes at the auth seam.

 * Kept as a tiny external store rather than React Query cache because the value
 * is written from a mutation's error path and read by the composer with a live
 * countdown — an imperative setter plus `useSyncExternalStore` is the smallest

 * out but not the live countdown. Mount the countdown UI
 * ({@link ComposerTimeoutBanner}) behind this flag; that component owns the
 * per-second tick and the clear-at-expiry effect, so the tick is scoped to its
 * lifetime and the flag flips (unmounting it) exactly when the block lifts.
 *
 * The snapshot is the raw `active` flag. When a known expiry passes, the flag
 * stays `true` until the mounted banner's effect calls `clearTimeoutState`,
 * which flips it to `false` on the next render — so a subscriber gated on this
 * boolean keeps the composer blocked until the store is actually cleared.
