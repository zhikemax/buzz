/**
 * Relative date labels shared by the chat timeline and the Inbox.

 * do it independently — chat via `messages/lib/dateFormatters.formatDayHeading`,
 * the Inbox inline inside `groupInboxItems` — and the two drifted apart: chat
 * appended an ordinal ("Monday, March 31st") while the Inbox always printed the
 * year ("Jul 8, 2026", even for a date three weeks ago).
 *
 * The ladder follows the Block writing standard for relative dates, with one
 * deliberate deviation noted on `formatDayGroupLabel`.
 *
 * Locale follows `getDateFormatLocale` (wired from LocaleProvider).

 * the year itself needs the room.
 *
 * Deliberate deviation from the standard: the standard collapses anything over
 * ten months old to month and year ("Aug 2022"). A group label has to *identify*
 * its day — collapsing would give every day in a month the same header, so
 * scrolling old history would show a run of identical dividers with no way to
 * tell one day from the next. The day is kept and only the year is conditional.
 *
 * No ordinal suffix ("June 20", never "June 20th"), per the standard.
 *
 * `nowSeconds` is injectable so the relative bands are testable; it must stay a
 * parameter rather than a captured constant, because a label rendered before
 * midnight has to say "Yesterday" once the day rolls over.
