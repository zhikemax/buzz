//! Rust archive sync task — the backend replacement for the renderer's
//! `archiveSyncManager`.
//!
//! Opens one live relay subscription per saved archive config and forwards
//! matched events to the existing archive pipeline in debounced batches. The
//! renderer no longer sees archive traffic at all: previously every matched
//! event crossed the IPC boundary twice (relay -> renderer, renderer ->
//! `archive_events`) purely to be written to a SQLite file the backend owns.
//!
//! # Start gate
//!
//! The task is NOT self-starting. Kind 24200 is relay-*ephemeral*: frames that
//! arrive before the listener opens are permanently lost, so the renderer must
//! finish observer reconciliation (which seeds kind 24200 into the owner_p
//! subscription) before any listener opens. That ordering is the whole reason
//! `useArchiveSync` gated on `observerReconciled`, and it survives the move as
//! an explicit `start_archive_sync` command issued after the same gate.
