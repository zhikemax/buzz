//! Windows process-tree lifecycle primitives for managed agents.
//!
//! The Unix teardown uses `process_group(0)` + group signals (in `runtime.rs`).
//! Windows has no process groups, so the harness's 24 agent workers + MCP
//! servers are reaped two ways here:
//!   - [`JobHandle`] / [`create_job_for_child`] — the in-process stop path. A
//!     Job Object owns the tree and `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` kills
//!     it when the handle drops.
//!   - [`taskkill_tree`] — the after-restart path, where only the PID survives
//!     in the record and no job handle is available.
//!
//! This module is `#[cfg(windows)]`-only; nothing here compiles on other
//! platforms.

/// places every subsequently-spawned descendant in the job automatically.
