// Canonical reserved-env-key list, `include!`d into BOTH `build.rs`
// (compile-time rejection of baked `BUZZ_BUILD_AGENT_ENV` collisions) and
// `managed_agents/env_vars.rs` (save-time validation and spawn-time
// filtering). Build scripts cannot import from the crate, so sharing the
// source via `include!` is what guarantees the build-time check and the
// runtime filter use one identical list — zero drift surface. See
// `commands/reconnect_hook_config.rs` for the same pattern.
//
// Keep this file dependency-free: no crate-internal imports, no external
// crates. Both consumers compile it as-is.

/// Env var keys that Buzz sets itself and users must not override from
/// the persona/agent env_vars UI. Three categories:
///
/// 1. **Identity / secrets** — overriding would swap the agent's nsec or
///    leak credentials.
/// 2. **Code-execution surface** — overriding the binary/args lets the
///    user run arbitrary code as the agent process.
/// 3. **Security gates** — overriding the respond-to mode/allowlist or
///    relay URL would silently break the saved security settings (the UI
///    shows owner-only while the running agent answers anyone, for
///    example), or redirect the agent to an attacker-controlled relay.
///
/// This list is deliberately narrow — it only covers keys with security
/// implications. Behavior knobs (GOOSE_MODE, BUZZ_ACP_MODEL, BUZZ_ACP_SYSTEM_PROMPT, …) remain freely
/// overridable; those have dedicated UI fields but power users may want
/// to bypass them.
