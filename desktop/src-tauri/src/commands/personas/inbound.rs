/// Apply an inbound kind:30175 persona event from the relay onto the local

/// Retention is a sync channel that writes INTO `personas.json`, never an
/// authoritative read source — `load_personas` is untouched, so every agent
/// keeps resolving its persona by UUID and keeps its provider keys.
///
/// MATCH KEY (single source of truth, both directions): an inbound event
/// matches the local record whose `persona_d_tag(record)` equals the event's
/// d-tag. Reusing the same derivation the outbound path uses guarantees the
/// inbound key can never drift from the outbound key — in particular, an
/// in-app persona (`source_team_persona_slug == None`) whose d-tag IS its
/// `id` matches its existing UUID row instead of minting a duplicate.
///
/// On match: patch ONLY the projected fields; preserve local `id`, `env_vars`,
/// `source_team`, and `created_at`. On no match: insert the parsed record as-is
/// — `persona_from_event` already sets `id = d_tag`, so an in-app persona reuses
/// its d-tag as the id and a re-received event stays idempotent (no duplicate).
///
/// The retention store decides whether the inbound event wins over a pending
/// local edit (`retain_inbound_event`): `personas.json` is only patched when the
/// retain reports [`InboundOutcome::Applied`], so an equal-second collision with
/// a pending local edit leaves the local record — and its queued publish —
/// untouched.
///
/// `arrival_relay_url` is the relay the calling subscription is bound to. The
/// retention store this event belongs to is decided by the community that
/// DELIVERED it, not by whichever community happens to be active when the
/// reconcile runs — a workspace switch in flight would otherwise file community
/// A's event into community B's scoped database. An event whose arrival relay is
/// no longer the active scope is dropped: it was already durable in its own
/// community's store when it arrived there, and that community's next boot
