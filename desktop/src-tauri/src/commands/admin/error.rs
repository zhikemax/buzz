//! Typed error for admin mutation commands.

/// Error from an admin mutation command, carrying whether the relay
/// authoritatively answered so the UI can decide idempotency-retry policy
/// without string-matching the message.
///
/// `relayStatus` is `Some(code)` only when the relay returned an HTTP status —
/// the request reached the relay and it answered. It is `None` for a
/// pre-response transport failure (`send()` error, DNS/connect/timeout) or a
/// pre-send failure (auth build, body serialisation): the relay never
/// committed anything, so a retry must reuse the same idempotency key.
///
/// `bodyComplete` is `true` only when the relay's full response body was read —
/// an authoritative verdict. A non-409 4xx with `bodyComplete: true` is a
/// definitive pre-commit rejection, so the UI may mint a fresh idempotency key.
/// A status that arrives but whose body is lost mid-stream (or rejected over
/// the size cap) carries `bodyComplete: false`: the outcome is unknown, so the
/// caller preserves idempotency and lets the retry dedupe even on a 4xx.
///
/// `notSent` is `true` only when the desktop refused the request before sending
/// it (a malformed intent, or the relay or signer changed): nothing reached the
/// relay, so retrying the same intent can never succeed.
///
/// Serialises `rename_all = "camelCase"`; the JS bridge surfaces it as the
/// rejected `TauriInvokeError.payload`, from which the UI reads `relayStatus`
/// and `bodyComplete`.
