//! The store-mutation half of `add_team_from_catalog`: turn a verified
//! projection into local records with byte-level rollback on error.
//!
//! [`plan_add`] computes both stores in memory before anything is written, so
//! a member-resolution failure cannot leave a half-added team on disk. Only
//! the two saves remain: before either write we snapshot the raw bytes of both
//! files (or record their absence), and on a failed save we restore both
//! snapshots byte-exactly — including a reactivated member copy whose logical
//! undo would be a field revert with no row to delete.
//!
//! **Crash window.** A kill between the two commits (or between the second and
//! a successful restore) leaves the stores inconsistent: the team without some
//! member copies, or the copies without the team. The next add of the same
//! publication is idempotent — the replay check in `plan_add` finds the team
//! if present, and orphaned copies are reused by provenance matching. Retry is
//! the recovery path.
