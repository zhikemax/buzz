//! Relay egress guard for NIP-49 key-backup material.
//!
//! The local `ncryptsec` backup (see [`crate::key_backup`]) must NEVER be
//! transmitted to a relay. This module enforces that contract at runtime,
//! fail-closed, at every relay-bound egress boundary:
//!
//! | # | Boundary | Site |
//! |---|----------|------|
//! | 1 | `submit_signed_event_at_with_keys` (funnel for `submit_event*`) | `relay/submit.rs` |
//! | 2 | `sync_managed_agent_profile` | `relay.rs` |
//! | 3 | pre-signed path into the boundary-1 funnel | `relay/submit.rs` |
//! | 4 | `submit_signed_event_with_keys` | `relay.rs` |
//! | 5 | huddle STT publisher | `huddle/pipeline.rs` |
//! | 6 | `submit_engram_event` (team snapshot) | `commands/team_snapshot.rs` |
//! | 7 | `submit_engram_event` (persona import) | `commands/personas/snapshot/import.rs` |
//! | 8 | native websocket send loop (all webview relay WS) | `native_websocket.rs` |
//! | 9 | `send_admin_mutation` (all admin API JSON bodies) | `commands/admin/helpers.rs` |
//!
//! The inventory-completeness test in `egress_guard_tests.rs` asserts that
//! every `/events` URL-construction site in the tree calls this guard, so a
//! new submission path fails the build until it is wired.
//!
//! Scope: `ncryptsec1` only. The raw `nsec` intentionally transits the
//! NIP-44-encrypted pairing session (NIP-AB payload_type "nsec"); guarding it
//! here would break pairing. Raw-key DLP is separate policy work.

/// Bech32 HRP of NIP-49 encrypted secret keys.
const NCRYPTSEC_PREFIX: &str = "ncryptsec1";
/// Bech32 also permits an ALL-UPPERCASE encoding of the same payload
/// (BIP-173); an uppercased valid backup decodes identically, so the guard
