//! The cluster-positioning contract: what the renderer may rely on to place
//! text at the right column without consulting Unicode tables.
//!
//! The consumer's rule reads two numbers off each span and does arithmetic:
//! `cluster_count == 1` means the whole text is one cluster at `column`,
//! otherwise cluster `i` is the i-th `char` at `column + i * width`.
//!
//! These fixtures exist because that rule is not self-evidently satisfiable --
//! the two cases below require *opposite* text-splitting rules, so no encoding
//! that ships a concatenated string and a start column can be correct:
//!
//! * a regional-indicator flag is two ordinary one-column cells, so its two
//!   codepoints occupy two columns and must split per codepoint;
//! * a keycap is one cell holding three codepoints, so it occupies one column
//!   and must split per grapheme.
//!
//! Both are handled here by construction rather than by rule: uniform `width`
//! within a span, and a span of its own for any cluster carrying zerowidth
//! marks.
